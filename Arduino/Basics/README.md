"Basics" guides will be performed on the *Arduino Uno Rev3*. Other boards and eventually shields will be discussed, but they are not required for this segment.  

## Pinout
The image above is a great markdown of the Uno's structure. If your board is a knock-off Uno (such as Geekcreit)The small black squares are called *pins*, and you are able to insert wires into them. Some pins may be hard to read, so zoom in as you see fit.  

## Important Features of the Uno
A lot of these features may also appear on other boards, as they are __standard to electronics and how they work.__  
**GND:** todo  
**VIN:** todo  
**Microcontroller:** todo  
**Digital:** todo  
**Analog:** todo  
**PWM:** The PWM pins are denoted by the tilde (~) markings and also the red check marks on the right. PWM means pulse-width modulation todo

## IDE Concepts
Arduino is a set of C/C++ functions that can be called on your code, which is passed onto its own compiler. Sketches are *.ino* files, and for those who become advanced, you may eventually have to write your own libraries in *.h* files.
