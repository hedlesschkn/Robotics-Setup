"Basics" guides will be performed on the *Arduino Uno Rev3*. Other boards and eventually shields will be discussed, but they are not required for this segment.  
  
After finishing all the examples, you may want to get started on your own code. The best way to do so is by first creating your own sketch, and then checking these websites out:
* https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/: Test out all the syntax of the Arduino language if you don't know what they do. You may find some methods / variables more useful than others in your project.
* https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Libraries: Each library gives you functionality for specific hardware. Whichever one you want to use, you can click on for more examples and pin structures on how to use.

## Pinout
The image above is a great markdown of the Uno's structure. If your board is a knock-off Uno (such as Geekcreit)The small black squares are called *pins*, and you are able to insert wires into them. Some pins may be hard to read, so zoom in as you see fit.  

## Important Features of the Uno
A lot of these features may also appear on other boards, as they are __standard to electronics and how they work.__  
**GND:** When a circuit is looked at locally, ground is simply the one net someone picked to call 0V so that all other voltages are understood to be relative to it. GND is a pin that can be referred to as negative voltage to cancel out the positive voltage. This is why we always need a GND when we have positive voltage going through our circuit.  
**VIN:** todo  
**Microcontroller:** todo  
**Digital:** todo  
**Analog:** todo  
**PWM:** The PWM pins are denoted by the tilde (~) markings and also the red check marks on the right. PWM means pulse-width modulation todo

## IDE Concepts
Arduino is a set of C/C++ functions that can be called on your code, which is passed onto its own compiler. Sketches are *.ino* files, and for those who become advanced, you may eventually have to write your own libraries in *.h* files.
